## [ SYSTEM_OVERVIEW ]

**CLONE(1)** is an industrial-grade web archiving tool engineered for precision and stealth. Built on the **Playwright** engine with a custom brutalist interface, it performs deep cloning of target websites, capturing dynamic assets, lazy-loaded images, and computed CSS that standard scrapers miss.
